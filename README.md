> ### :rotating_light: Project is in active development and not ready to be used. Check back later. :rotating_light:

App Center is mission control for mobile apps. Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.

## Plugins

The Capacitor App Center SDK consists of a several plugins so you can use any or all of the supported App Center services. This SDK uses a modular approach, where you just add the modules for App Center services that you want to use. `appcenter-analytics` and `appcenter-crashes` make sense to add to almost every app, as they provide value with no additional setup required. `appcenter` provides general purpose App Center APIs, useful for multiple services.

## ðŸ“± Example Mobile App

You can get familiar with SDK quickly by cloning this repository and running the sample app in `example` directory. For further instructions please refer to [example's README](example/README.md)

## 1. ðŸ“¦ Installation

Add the App Center plugin(s) that fit your needs directly from the CLI:

```bash
npm i @capacitor-community/appcenter @capacitor-community/appcenter-analytics
npx cap sync
```

This will install two of the plugins available today.

## 2. ðŸ›  Link the SDK

To get it working in your app you will need to add some configuration values to your app configuration in `capacitor.config.json` file. See list of available parameters below

- `AppSecret` - _(required)_ App secret which enables App Center to map this app to the right user account

Example:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appName": "example",
  "webDir": "www",
  "bundledWebRuntime": false,
  "AppCenter": {
    "iosAppSecret": "0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "androidAppSecret": "0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
  ...

}
```

Notice that it's likely that Android and iOS platforms will be associated with different applications on App Center portal so you would need to add this preference twice - one for Android and another for iOS.

### Config Options

These options are required in `capacitor.config.json`
